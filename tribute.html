        Sindhutai 

        Sapkal was born on 14 November 1948, in Pimpri Meghe village in Wardha
         district in the then Central Provinces and Berar of British India to Abhimanyu Sathe, a cowherder
          Being an unwanted child, she was referred to as Chindhi (Marathi for "torn piece of cloth")
         . Abject poverty, family responsibilities and an early marriage forced her to quit formal education
          after she successfully passed the fourth standard.Sapkal was married off at age 12 to Shrihari
           Sapkal, who was 20 years elder to her, and moved to Nawargaon village, Seloo in Wardha.
            The marriage did not 
        last long and at the age of 20,[5] she was left on her own to care for a girl 
        child.

            Sindhutai Sapkal later found herself in Chikhaldara, where she started begging on railway platforms 
            for food. In the process, she realised that there were many children abandoned by their parents and
             she adopted them as her own. She then begged more vigorously to feed them. She decided to become
              a mother to everyone who came across to her as an orphan. She later donated her biological child
               to the trust Shrimant Dagdu Sheth Halwai,
             Pune, to eliminate the feeling of partiality between her biological child and the adopted ch
